        Offspring - Shit is fucked up (part of lyrics)<br />
        <br />
        Now, I don't know and its hard to explain, but it seems like things are<br />
        just kind of insane because the world is crying but nobodys listening so<br />
        please leave a message on my cell phone<br />
        <br />
        I see bullets getting better Biblical weather<br />
        And the guy on T.V. is like a total asshole<br />
        What are you wearing tonight?<br />
        Celebrity fundraiser tight Blackties making wrongs right How's your social bandaid?<br />

        <br />I don't know much
        <br />I don't know too much
        <br />But I know this
        <br />Shit is fucked up
        <br />La, La, La La, La
        <br />I guess it's all about the dream
        <br />La, La, La La, La
        <br />The ends justify the means
        <br />La, La, La La, La La La
        <br />I'm telling you
        <br />Shit is fucked up
        <br />
        <br />La, La, La La, La
        <br />You know it's all about the dream
        <br />La, La, La La, La
        <br />The ends justify the means
        <br />La, La, La La, La La La
        <br />
        <br />Now thank God for the media
        <br />For saving the day
        <br />Puting it all into perspective in a responsible way
        <br />With more celebrity news Typical bullshit views
        <br />I think we're losing this fight sponsored by Bud Light
